# Language-Lookup

[Click here to view or install the Firefox extension!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/language-lookup/)

An extension I made for Firefox that will look up the definition of a non-English word via that country's main dictionary website for maximum understanding!

If I end up not being the only person using this on a regular basis then I will try to fancy it up a bit and enhance its usability (e.g. more languages, more customizability).  Otherwise, the way it currently is works perfectly fine for me and I will use this perpetually for my own uses of language learning.
